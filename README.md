# Snake-game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python. The Snake Game is a popular arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food while avoiding collision with the boundaries of the game screen and itself.
How to Play

    Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
    The snake will continuously move in the direction it's facing.
    The goal is to eat the red food items that appear on the screen.
    Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer.
    The game ends when the snake collides with the game boundaries or itself.
